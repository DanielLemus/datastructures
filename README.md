# Arrays

- [x] Sorting: Reordering elements in an array in a specific order.
Searching: Finding the index or value of a specific element in an array.
Filtering: Creating a new array containing only elements that meet certain criteria.
Mapping: Creating a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
Reducing/Aggregating: Combining all elements of an array into a single value (e.g., sum, average, maximum).
- [x] Iterating/Looping: Accessing each element in an array sequentially.
Inserting/Adding: Adding elements to an array at specific positions.
Removing/Deleting: Removing elements from an array at specific positions.
Concatenating: Combining multiple arrays into a single array.
Copying/Cloning: Creating a duplicate of an existing array.
Slicing: Extracting a portion of an array into a new array.
[x] Merging/Merging: Combining two arrays into one, possibly based on some condition.
Shuffling: Randomly rearranging the elements of an array.
[x] Reversing: Changing the order of elements in an array.
[x] Rotating: Moving elements of an array circularly by a certain number of positions.
Searching Algorithms: Techniques for efficiently finding elements or subsets within an array (e.g., binary search).
[x] Two Pointers Technique: Optimizing algorithms by using two pointers to iterate through an array simultaneously.
[x] Sliding Window Technique: Efficiently solving problems involving subarrays of fixed length within an array.
[x] Prefix Sum: Optimizing algorithms by precomputing cumulative sums of elements in an array.
[x] Subarray Problems: Dealing with problems involving contiguous subsets of an array.
[x] Cyclic Rotation: Rotating arrays in a way that the rotation is cyclic, often used for finding patterns or equivalences.
[x] Equilibrium Index: Finding the index where the sum of elements on the left equals the sum on the right.
[x] Maximal Subarray Sum: Finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within an array.
[x] Intersection of Arrays: Finding common elements between two arrays.
[x] Sparse Arrays: Handling arrays with a large number of default or zero values efficiently.
[x] Merge Sort: Efficiently sorting an array using the merge sort algorithm.
[x] Sparse Arrays: Handling arrays with a large number of default or zero values efficiently.
